Contrib implementations of Path or Filesystem objects are considered experimental.
Even by the standards of this package.
The ideal evolution of such implementations would be to graduate into ffs.path and ffs.filesystem.
However they may equally well just disappear, having been determined a Bad Idea.

Implementations under consideration:

HTTPPath (contrib-http
ZookeeperPath (contrib-zk)
HadoopFSPath
SFTPPath
FTPPath
